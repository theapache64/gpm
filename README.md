# gpm 📦

**gpm** is a package manager for Gradle projects. It is inspired from the famous **npm** package manager.
 **gpm** is not a replacement for the Gradle build system, but a helper to install the dependencies seamlessly to reduce latency.

 It consists of a command line client, also called **gpm**, and an online database of package directory, called the **gpm registry**.

**gpm** uses similar syntax as **npm**.
